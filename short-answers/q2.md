# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. One is by wrapping the input in a label (implicit), and the other is by adding a for attribute to the label and an id to the input (explicit).
