# Question

Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer

The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. One is by wrapping the input in a label (implicit), and the other is by adding a for attribute to the label and an id to the input (explicit).

Good job identifying the two methods of associating labels with inputs, but don't forget to mention that labels are crucial for accessibility and improve usability by increasing the clickable area.
