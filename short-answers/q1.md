# Question
Say I have a form on a page with an input for a user's email and password. When you click the submit button, suddenly the url goes from:

```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/
```
to this:
```plaintext
https://localhost:8000/?email=tom%40gmail.com&password=123456
```

The whole page refreshed as well. Why did that happen, and how can we stop it?

# Answer
That happen because you submit form and data form by default that setup to send the data to the server. 
We can use event.preventDefault() method within an event listener to stop the default form's submit event.
