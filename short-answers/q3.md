# Question

Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer

The default behavior for a <button> element without a specified type attribute is to act as a submit button when placed inside a form.
When clicked, it will submit the form in which it resides.

A button with type="submit" explicitly set will submit the form in which it resides.
When clicked, the form's data is sent to the server for processing, typically defined by the action attribute of the <form> element.

A button with type="reset" will reset all the input fields in the form to their initial values.
When clicked, any changes made by the user in the form fields will be undone, and the fields will revert to their original state.

A button with type="button" has no default behavior.
When clicked, it does nothing unless it's tied to some JavaScript action or event handler.
It is typically used for custom functionality like triggering JavaScript functions when clicked.
